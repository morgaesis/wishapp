# WishApp Code Review Results - Improvements Needed

## Architecture Issues
1. **Code Organization**:
   - [x] Resolved duplicate routing logic between main.rs/lib.rs
   - [x] Established clear separation between library and binary
   - [x] Moved all routing to lib.rs with minimal main.rs

2. **Storage**:
   - Using in-memory storage (WISHLISTS static) not suitable for production
   - No persistence between Lambda invocations
   - Suggestion: Implement DynamoDB integration or similar

## Code Quality
1. **Error Handling**:
   - Basic error handling could be improved
   - Consider custom error types
   - More detailed error responses

2. **Logging**:
   - Replace println! with proper logging (log/tracing crates)
   - Add request/response logging middleware
   - Structured logging would help debugging

3. **Documentation**:
   - [x] Added module-level documentation
   - [x] Added function documentation for routing
   - [ ] Still needed: Example usage docs
   - [ ] Still needed: More function/type docs

## Testing Improvements
1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Expand basic Wishlist struct tests
   - Add validation method tests
   - Test edge cases (empty strings, max lengths)

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Reduce test duplication (common setup/teardown)
   - Add concurrency tests
   - Test with realistic data volumes

3. **E2E Tests**:
   - Expand to cover full API surface
   - Add negative test cases
   - Consider using test client library

## Suggested Improvements
1. **Data Model**:
   - Consider making Item a proper struct instead of String
   - Add validation methods to Wishlist
   - Consider adding timestamps

2. **API Enhancements**:
   - Pagination for wishlists
   - Filtering/sorting
   - Bulk operations

3. **Infrastructure**:
   - Add proper AWS integration
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline
   - Add monitoring/alerting
