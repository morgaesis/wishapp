# WishApp Code Review Results - Improvements Needed

## Critical Security Findings
1. chrono v0.4.40 - Contains known vulnerabilities (RUSTSEC-2024-0006)
   - Recommended action: Upgrade to chrono 0.4.41 or later
2. Dependency Audit - Need full security audit
   - Action: Run cargo-audit when available

## Architecture Issues
1. **Code Organization**:
   - [x] Resolved duplicate routing logic between main.rs/lib.rs
   - [x] Established clear separation between library and binary
   - [x] Moved all routing to lib.rs with minimal main.rs

2. **Storage**:
   - Using in-memory storage (WISHLISTS static) not suitable for production
   - No persistence between Lambda invocations
   - Suggestion: Implement DynamoDB integration or similar
